rtorgmode is a very simple Python web app. It takes your
[Remember The Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) (aka RTM) task
lists and exports them in a format compatible with
[emacs org-mode](http://orgmode.org/).

This product uses the Remember The Milk API but is not endorsed or
certified by Remember The Milk.


# Hosted Version

You can use a [hosted version of rtorgmode online](http://chainxor.org/rtorgmode),
but this README shows how to run it standalone on your computer.


# Prerequisites To Run It Yourself

* [milky](https://bitbucket.org/Surgo/milky/src), a Python RTM
  client. There's no pip/easy_install for this module, so I just copied
  the "milky" module directory straight into the rtorgmode
  directory.

* [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org) web framework (*pip install
  bottle* or *apt-get install python-bottle* or similar.)

* You'll need your own [RTM API Key](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/api/keys.rtm)

* Create a file in the rtorgmode directory called "api_key.py" with your RTM API key, like this:

	API_KEY = "myapikeyinquotes"
	API_SECRET = "myapikeysharedsecretinquotes"


# Running It Yourself

Run:

    python rtorgmode.py

This creates a web server running on http://localhost:8000. The first
time you load this URL in your browser it will redirect you to RTM to
authorise your app.

# Authorisation

The rtorgmode script expects to receive a callback redirect from RTM
of the form *localhost:8000/?frob=123456*, with the 123456 frob value
supplied by RTM to authorise access.

When running locally and standalone, you can get by if you look at the
*Application successfully authorized* page that appears after you
authorise your app in RTM. Look at the URL bar and copy the frob,
which is the part between *frob=* and *&*. Then paste it into a new
URL of the form *http://localhost:8000/?frob=* and the exporter will
run.

You have to do this every time you run an export, because rtorgmode
doesn't save any information, including the RTM authentication token.
